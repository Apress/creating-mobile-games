-----------------------------------------------------

To build these projects, first you must download and install the
Wireless Toolkit from Sun, as explained in Chapter 1 of the book.

For each chapter, take the folders directly under the Chapter** folder
and copy them into the WTK's apps folder.  From there, they can be
built using the ktoolbar application, as explained in Chapter 1.

The only exception is the servlet folder in Chapter06.  This code
needs to be run by a web server as explained in Chapter 6.
